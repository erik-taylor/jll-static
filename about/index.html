    						<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Hello there, I’m Leah! A travel and sustainability blogger living in San Diego, CA with a goal to see the world, while living a low impact lifestyle. These may seem like contrasting goals, but it absolutely can be done and I want to show you how! I believe life is always a little more exciting when I have a trip to look forward to and never leave the house without my water bottle and a reusable bag.</p>
    
    <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">At a young age, my parents instilled in me a passion for adventure, a curiosity for new experiences and a respect for other people and the planet. At age 12, I got my first passport and started traveling on my own during college. I took my first solo airplane trip just before my 19th birthday to go snowboarding in Colorado. A few days after I turned 20 I embarked on a semester abroad in Budapest, Hungary. In July of 2019 I reached my goal of visiting 30 countries before my 30th birthday. Check out the Adventures tab for travel tips and location guides.</p>
    
    <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">I have been called a tree hugger, a dirty hippy and a weirdo more times than I can count, but I have never really thought of myself that way (maybe weirdo, but that is another story). As a child I would talk to the trees in my backyard and I tried to plant a vegetable garden with my mom. Unfortunately, the deer and raccoons harvested it all before we did. I have spent my fair share of hours rummaging through the bins and racks at thrift shops (pre-Macklemore).</p> 
    
    <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">At 18 years old, when I learned of the negative impacts conventional animal farming has on the environmental and the human body, I became a vegetarian. However, my commitment to living a low impact lifestyle is relatively new. I am on a learning journey and by no means doing everything absolutely perfect. However, I am trying my best. Learn along with me in the sustainability tab on my blog, and every sunday on my instagram with #SustainableSunday series.</p>
    
    <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">If I can inspire you to go on an adventure, regardless if it’s across the world or across town or just to live life a little more sustainably, I have done my job.</p>
    
    <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Some fun facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
    <li class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeInOut">I grew up in Cincinnati, OH, but I have lived in 5 US states and 2 countries.</li>
    <li class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeInOut">I believe there is not a single food in this world that can not be improved by adding cheese.</li>
    <li class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeInOut">I have a sweet kitty named Luna and she loves going on walks and climbing on everything in our apartment.</li>
    <li class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeInOut">I have been vegetarian for 10+ years</li>
    <li class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeInOut">I am a huuuuuge fan of both The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter universes, let's get nerdy!</li>
