    					<h2 id="everyone-s-favorite-art-treasure-hut-is-back-">Everyone’s favorite art treasure hut is back!!!</h2><p>Desert X is a collection of art installations scattered throughout the desert in the Coachella Valley of California that happens every other year during the spring. All the installations are open to the public and totally free. You just have to find them! Luckily they have a handy-dandy <a href="https://desertx.org/dx/desert-x-21/desert-x-app" target="_blank">mobile app</a>. The app contains descriptions of the exhibits, info about the artists and a map of where each exhibit is located. You can also stop by the Ace hotel to find a physical map and grab some Desert X merch.</p>
    <p>This year, Desert X is happening March 12th - May 16th 2021, so there is still time to book your hotel room, rental home or campsite for your stay. If you want to see all the installations in one day, be prepared for a full day adventure. Don’t forget to pack plenty of water, sunscreen, snacks, and a charging pack for your phone! </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616641602_DSCF7517.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616641602_DSCF7517.jpg" alt="Leah visits Para Pivot" /></p>
    <h2 id="para-pivot-sempiternal-clouds-">Para Pivot (sempiternal clouds)</h2><p><em>Artist: Alicia Kwade</em></p>
    <p>A combination of large black frames, glittering marble and negative space made this one of my favorite stops of the day! The piece changes with your perspective providing visual interest at every angle. Located on an empty residential lot, it was a bit of a hike up a winding driveway and be aware: it was incredibly windy at the installation site. So be aware and dress accordingly. </p>
    <p>This installation requires tickets, but when I went they were allowing walk-ups as long as there were less than 15 people viewing the exhibit at a time. </p>
    <p>Hours: 10am-5pm, gated entrance<br>Parking: Unpaved roadside parking<br>Bathroom: None<br>Accessibility: Around ¼ mile of very steep, uphill driveway and unpaved plateau at the top. </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642947_DSCF7522.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642947_DSCF7522.jpg" alt="Para Pivot" /></p>
    <h2 id="jackrabbit-homestead">Jackrabbit Homestead</h2><p><em>Artist: Kim Stringfellow</em></p>
    <p>A 122-square-foot kit home built on an open patch of land between 2 strip malls. This style of house was very popular in the 1950’s and it is furnished to match the 50’s aesthetic. This is the only installation that incorporates audio to bring the visitor into the experience. On one end of the house there is a speaker that plays a recorded expert from Desert Magazine of a woman recounting her stay in a similar house in the 50’s. </p>
    <p>Hours: Sunrise to Sunset<br>Parking: Paved lot in the strip mall<br>Bathroom: You could potentially use the bathroom of one of the surrounding stores.<br>Accessibility: The home is about 50 yards from the lot, the ground is fine gravel and relatively even.   </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642973_DSCF7622.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642973_DSCF7622.jpg" alt="Jackrabbit Homestead" /></p>
    <h2 id="the-passenger">The Passenger</h2><p><em>Artist: Eduardo Sarabia</em></p>
    <p>A large arrow tip shaped maze, designed to bring the viewer more connected to desert journey stories. The walls are made of petites (palm fibers woven into rugs) giving it a truly “could be any desert at any time” feel. As you walk through the maze, take a few moments to reflect on your own journey. </p>
    <p>This installation requires tickets, but when I went they were allowing walk ups as long as there were less than 15 people in the installation at a time. </p>
    <p>Hours: 10am - 5pm<br>Parking: Blocked off street parking<br>Bathroom: None<br>Accessibility: It is about 100 yards from the road, the terrain is soft sand and a little difficult to walk on in flimsy sandals.  </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616643018_DSCF7739.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616643018_DSCF7739.jpg" alt="The Passenger" /></p>
    <h2 id="women-s-qualities">Women’s Qualities</h2><p><em>Artist: Ghana Amer</em></p>
    <p>In the garden of the Sunnylands Center, the artist constructed letter shaped planters and used them to spell out qualities she and others ascribe to women. The words “resilience”, “peace”, “strong” and “beauty” are arranged in a circle and can be enjoyed from inside or outside the circle. There is also a video playing inside the center that has some lovely drone footage of the installation from above so be sure to check that out while you are there.  </p>
    <p>The Sunnylands Center and Gardens has a very well curated museum-like center and beautifully maintained garden. It is worth scheduling a little extra time to enjoy what it has to offer. </p>
    <p>Hours: 8:30am - 4pm Wednesday-Sunday<br>Parking: Paved lot at the Sunnylands Center and Gardens<br>Bathroom: In the Sunnylands Center<br>Accessibility: Well maintained sidewalks throughout  </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616643053_IMG_2046.JPG" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616643053_IMG_2046.JPG" alt="Women's Qualities" /></p>
    <h2 id="tamanrasset">Tamanrasset</h2><p><em>Artist: Vivian Suter</em></p>
    <p>A collection of large abstract paintings inspired by the Coachella Valley. While the art in this installation is hanging inside a building, it can only be viewed from the outside. Some times of day are better than others due to the reflections in the windows, I would recommend the afternoon or evening time when the sun is causing such harsh reflections. </p>
    <p>Hours: Sunrise to Sunset<br>Parking: Paved lot behind the building<br>Bathroom: Potentially in one of the surrounds stores<br>Accessibility: Well maintained sidewalks and ramps.  </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642778_DSCF7135.JPG" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642778_DSCF7135.JPG" alt="Tamanrasset" /></p>
    <h2 id="because-you-know-ultimately-we-will-band-a-militia">Because You Know Ultimately We Will Band A Militia</h2><p><em>Artist: Xaviera Simmons</em></p>
    <p>Alongside a busy 4 lane road there is a group of billboards. They have been erected to display quotes, facts and ideas with powerful images regarding America’s relationship with Black people. There is not designated parking and it is meant to be viewed from the road. It is worth doing the drive a few times to truly (and safely) take in the message of each billboard. </p>
    <p>Hours: 24/7<br>Parking: None<br>Bathroom: None<br>Accessibility: n/a  </p>
    <h2 id="never-forget">Never Forget</h2><p><em>Artist: Nicholas Galanin</em></p>
    <p>Large letters spelling out “INDIAN LAND” reminiscent of the Hollywood sign that read ‘HOLLYWOODLAND” when it was erected in 1923. The display offers a QR code linking to a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/landback" target="_blank">GoFundMe</a> started by the artist with the purpose to help indigenous people regain the land taken from them as part of the LandBack movement.  </p>
    <p>Hours: Sunrise to Sunset<br>Parking: A small paved lot and unpaved overflow parking<br>Bathroom: In the Visitor&#39;s Center<br>Accessibility: Can be viewed from the parking lot but there is also a gravel walkway to view from other perspectives.   </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642859_DSCF7167.JPG" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642859_DSCF7167.JPG" alt="Never Forget" /></p>
    <h2 id="the-wishing-well">The Wishing Well</h2><p><em>Artists: Serge Attukwei Clottey</em></p>
    <p>Two large cubes covered in small squares of yellow plastic. The plastic mainly came from Kufuor gallons used for water transportation in Ghana where the artist is from. While there I noticed pieces of plastic in all shades of yellow and orange, as well as other materials such as a license plate pieces that really give the installation a lot of dimension. </p>
    <p>Hours: Sunrise to Sunset<br>Parking: Paved lot<br>Bathroom: Porta potty<br>Accessibility: About 50 yards of well maintained grass but can also be viewed from the parking lot.  </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642886_DSCF7308.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642886_DSCF7308.jpg" alt="The Wishing Well" /></p>
    <h2 id="what-lies-behind-the-walls">What Lies Behind the Walls</h2><p><em>Artist: Zahrah Alghamdi</em></p>
    <p>What appears to be just a large brown wall from the parking lot is actually a large stack of material, covered in dirt, sand, dye and cement found both in the Coachella Valley and the artist’s home of Saudi Arabia. It created a beautiful striation effect. The artist notes how her home country and Palm Springs share very similar landscape and architecture, so she wanted to bring the two cities together with her installation. </p>
    <p>Hours: Sunrise to Sunset<br>Parking: Unpaved parking lot<br>Bathroom: None<br>Accessibility: About 200 yards uphill on a maintained but unpaved walkway   </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642908_DSCF7419.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642908_DSCF7419.jpg" alt="What Lies Behind the Walls" /></p>
    <h2 id="bonus-em-the-north-face-x-gucci-pit-stop-em-">Bonus: <em>The North Face X Gucci Pit Stop</em></h2><p>In a year when so many of the Desert X pieces focus on social justice issues, this seems like an “out of left field” addition. That being said, it does provide a bit of whimsy and color, more present in Desert X of previous years. I also hear it lights up at night and it looks very neat so check it out around sunset if you have time! </p>
    <p>Hours: Sunrise- Sunset<br>Parking: Street parking<br>Bathroom: None<br>Accessibility: Can be viewed from paved sidewalk or about 10 yards of hard packed dirt   </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642823_DSCF7144.JPG" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1616642823_DSCF7144.JPG" alt="North Face/Gucci installation" /></p>
    <h2 id="finding-home-in-my-own-flesh">FInding Home in My Own Flesh</h2><p><em>Artist: Felipe Baeza (not open unit April 9th)</em> </p>
    <p>This installation was not open when I visited. </p>
    <h2 id="frequencies">Frequencies</h2><p><em>Artist: Oscar Murillo</em></p>
    <p>This installation was not open when I visited </p>
    <h2 id="the-art-of-taming-horses">The Art of Taming Horses</h2><p><em>Artist: Christopher Myers</em></p>
    <p>This installation was on the map in the app, but not the map on the website. The location of this particular sculpture has been up for debate and it is unclear if it will be on display later in the spring. </p>
    <h2 id="living-smoke">Living Smoke</h2><p><em>Artist: Judy Chicago</em> </p>
    <p>The venue originally proposed for this “smoke sculpture” has pulled out due to unwarranted environmental concerns. The “performance” was planned for April 9th and as of now it is unclear if a new location has been approved. </p>
    <p>Cheers, </p>
