    					<p>Today I turn 30. While there are a lot of people out there who truly dread being a decade older, I am actually really excited about it! You see, I did a lot in my 20’s. I had all kinds of adventures, graduated college, experienced heartache, found true love, made some decisions that turned out great, some that I wished I had thought out better and lived in 6 cities, 4 states and 2 countries. </p>
    <p>In my 29th year, I accomplished a major goal, 29 years (well two years actively) in the making. I was able to add my 30th country to my list of places visited, most of which I went in my 20&#39;s. Yes 30 is not the biggest number out there but it is an accomplishment worth celebrating nonetheless, especially since I almost didn’t achieve it. In late 2017 I was curious how many countries I had visited, so I made a list. I realized that with the combination of my semester abroad, trips taken with friends/partners and family vacations, I had visited 26 different countries. However, because I always have the itch to travel, and like round numbers, I immediately made a goal to visit 30 countries before I turn 30. Four countries in a little over two years seemed totally achievable!</p>
    <p>In 2018, instead of going back to Cincinnati to visit for the Thanksgiving holiday, I went to Argentina and Uruguay for a week. I was able to add country 27 and 28! Or so I thought... Shortly after I returned, I started planning my next trip.  During the trip-planning process, I took another look at my list and realized I had miscounted! I actually  only had 27 total and needed 3 more countries to make 30. I spent a full day feeling like the biggest ding bat on the planet before buckling down and trying to figure out how to squeeze in another trip. A trip that I did not budget for financially or with my time off from work. My first thought was to add another country in the Caribbean during our sailing trip, but the charter company we were renting the boat from said that with our timeframe, it would not be possible. I started looking up locations that would be nice but inexpensive in early January 2020 (happy 30th birthday to me!) but I was coming up short. I decided to dedicate my full attention to county 30 when I returned from the sailing trip, even if it meant taking unpaid time off from work and dipping into my “emergency fund” to make it happen. This WAS an emergency!</p>
    <p>The travel gods must have been smiling down on me on that trip because on our first night at sea, I began talking to a couple at dinner who highly recommended we visit Grenada while we were in the area. I told them we would love to but we didn’t have time to go any further south than Petite St. Vincent. Well low and behold! Petite Martinique, the northernmost island of Grenada is RIGHT ACROSS THE BAY from Petite St. Vincent. The best part? No need to even raise anchor, we could just take the dingy over. The island is relatively self governing because it is so small. At 586 acres and a population of about 1000 people and there is not a customs office on the island, which is why the charter company did not mention it. The island does not get a lot of tourists, especially during the off season (June-November) so things were relatively quiet. Not much was open but we found a man who said he would open his restaurant for us to have lunch. We drank delicious fruity beach cocktails (because vacation vibes!) and I had some of the most fantastic battered fish of my life! After lunch we walked around the “downtown,” a small market with a few shops. I wish we could have spent more time on the island but it started looking like a storm might blow in, so we had to get back to the boat. The dingy ride back was choppy and we all got soaked but I didn’t care, I had reached my goal! I had visited 30 countries before I turned 30!! </p>
    <p>My favorite part of traveling is how much I learn. Every country has its own experiences and lessons, so I actually made a list of of 30 things I have learned in my 30 year in 30 countries*. My hope is that this list may help a new traveler out there avoid some of the mistakes I made and encourages them to learn new lessons and make some mistakes of their own.</p>
