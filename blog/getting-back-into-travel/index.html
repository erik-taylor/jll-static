    					<h2 id="getting-back-into-travel">Getting Back into Travel</h2><p>Have you completely forgotten how to prepare for a trip in the last 19+ months of lockdown? It’s okay, I did too! I feel like all my travel tips and hacks were deleted from my brain to make room for bread recipes and tiktok dances. Luckily I have been doing this for a long time and it all came back to me while preparing for my first trip back, just like riding a bicycle!</p>
                        <p>As people start to venture out of their bubble again, I hope this may serve as a helpful reminder of the best travel practices in this “new normal”.</p>
    <h2 id="booking-the-cheapest-flights">Booking the cheapest flights</h2>
    <p>Search your desired destination on google flights using an incognito window. I have seen as much as a $200 difference between incognito and regular because travel websites track your searching, if they see you looked at flights to Costa Rica 3x this week, they think you are pretty serious about this trip and they might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of you. Once you have your location and dates nailed down, set price alerts for the 2-3 itineraries you like best. Be prepared to book when the price is right. The only major US airline google flights does not include is Southwest. To see their rates, you will need to go to their website or app.</p>

<p>I highly recommend booking directly with the airline or through a Travel Agency right now. Most major airlines are offering unheard-of flexibility at this time (Aug 2021) that may not be available when booked via a 3rd party like Cheapo Air or Trivago.</p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/sunset_plane_wing.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/sunset_plane_wing.jpg" alt="Sunset plane wing" /></p>

    <h2 id="book-your-rental-car-early">Book your rental car early</h2>
    <p>If you need a rental car, book as early as possible. Most rental car companies sold off a lot of their inventory to stay afloat while people were not traveling. This combined with many car manufacturing factories being shut down or at lower capacity for the majority of the pandemic has created a shortage of rental cars in the US. Do not wait until the last minute to book a rental car if you can avoid it.</p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/driving_car.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/driving_car.jpg" alt="Car trip driver" /></p>
    <h2 id="clean-out-and-refill-your-toiletries-containers">Clean out and refill your toiletries containers</h2><p>Yes, soap and shampoo go bad. When preparing for my last trip I noticed that my travel face wash had crystallized since I last used it. Make sure to go through all the products sitting in your travel toiletries bag from 2019 (or earlier) and refill with fresh product. This is also a great opportunity to use a few of those samples you got in your last Sephora order, you know, the ones that are just sitting under your bathroom sink collecting dust. Maybe you will find a new favorite shampoo in the process!</p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/skincare.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/skincare.jpg" alt="Skincare product" /></p>
    <h2 id="make-a-packing-list-and-start-early">Make a packing list and start early</h2><p>I like to start my packing list at least a week in advance and add to it as I think of things I want or need to bring. I like to keep my list on the reminders app of my iPhone because it keeps all my old list items so I can go through and re-add all the things I need for every trip but typically forget, like socks or emergency melatonin.</p>
    <h2 id="pack-disinfecting-wipes-and-hand-sanitizer-somewhere-easily-accessible">Pack disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer somewhere easily accessible</h2><p>Most airlines will give you one disinfecting wipe to clean your seat before you settle in for the flight. However, you may be someone who wants to wipe down your seat, your tray, your light and air nozzles, your table at the airport bar, your entire hotel room and/or the handhold in public transportation. In that case, grab a pack or 2 of travel wipes to ensure your surroundings are always to your comfort level.</p>
    <p><em>**These next 2 are specific to International travel</em></p>
    <h2 id="Check-when-your-passport-expires">Check when your passport expires</h2>
    <p>If you are planning on going out of the country in the next year, check your passport. Most countries require your passport to be valid for 6 month after your arrival. In the US right now, there is a major backup in the passport renewal department and I have seen estimated wait times as long as 3+ months.</p>
    <p><img class="blog-image b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/passport_open.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/passport_open.jpg" alt="open passport" /></p>
    <h2 id="Keep-an-eye-on-the-travel-requirements">Keep an eye on the travel requirements</h2>
    <p>The COVID-19 restrictions for people crossing borders changes daily, so keep an eye on the vaccination/testing/mask requirements for where you are going. Many of my travel agent friends recommend <a href="https://apply.joinsherpa.com/travel-restrictions" target="_blank">Sherpa</a> It is super easy to input where you are from and where you are going and learn the requirements to enter each country and return to your home country.</p>
    <p>Please, please, please remember to be kind and respectful to your fellow humans throughout your travel, this is a stressful process for everyone.</p>
    
    <p>Cheers, </p>
