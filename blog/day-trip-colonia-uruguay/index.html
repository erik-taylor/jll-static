    					<p>As part of E and my recent trip to Argentina we decided to take a day trip to Uruguay because how could we not? It is right there!  After doing some research we decided to take the Barquebus, a ferryboat from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. The boat ride is a little over one-hour boat ride each way, and make sure you leave time for security and customs.  Due to a miscommunication with our taxi driver, we arrived much later than we intended too and were some of the last people on the boat.  </p>
    <p>Our tickets included a box meal and a ½ day guided bus and walking tour of the city so when we docked in Colonia we hopped on our bus and did a quick loop and drive by of some of the historic sights outside of the city center.  Next was the walking tour of the historic quarter. Our guide gave us a history lesson on the alternating occupation by the Spanish and Portuguese and how to identify if the Spanish or the Portuguese built a particular building or street.  After the tour we had full access to hop on and off the bus to more fully explore the sights that we drove past in the beginning of the day, including the ruins of an old coliseum and a beautiful sandy beach. </p>
    <aside class="aside-right">PRO TIP: There is no need to exchanges money for a day trip to Colonia, every place we entered accepted Argentine pesos and US dollars as well as euros and currencies from other parts of South America.</aside>
    
    <p>Since the tour was only a ½ day tour, when it was over it was time for lunch. E and I got a restaurant recommendation from our tour guide and stopped in for a bite to eat and a split bottle of Uruguayan Tannat, a lovely red wine that Uruguay is known for. After a leisurely lunch we went to see the church and the lighthouse, the two major landmarks in the historic quarter.  The church was quiet, small and simple but we learned from our guide that it has undergone many changes in the past and it looked a lot different depending on who was occupying the town at the time. The top of the lighthouse provided stunning views of the city and water and we were also able to see some storm clouds on the horizon that told us, maybe this wasn’t the best time to hop on the bus and go to the beach. Instead we wandered around some of the shops. </p>
    <p>All in all, we were in Colonia for about eight hours and in my opinion, that was the perfect amount of time. I think if it had not looked like it was going to storm, and we were able to spend some time on the beach or walking around some of the more remote stops on the bus route we would have wanted more time. </p>
    <p>I love doing quick city tours, especially when I am only in a location for a short amount of time. I find I gain a greater appreciation for a city than I do from reading the overview in a travel book or the Internet. I also love the little personal touches a local guide will throw in about their city. Do you like having a tour guide, do you prefer self guided or do you just wander around and hope there are signs?</p>
