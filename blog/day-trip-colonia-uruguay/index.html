    <p>As part my recent trip to Argentina, I decided to take a day trip to Uruguay because...how could I not? It’s so close!  After researching transportation choices I decided to take the Buquebus, a ferryboat from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. The boat ride is a little over one-hour each way, but make sure you leave extra time for security and customs if you want a good seat.  Due to a miscommunication with the taxi driver, I arrived much later than I intended and was one of the last few people to get on the boat. </p>
    <p><img class="blog-image-right b-lazy" src="/remote/direct_uploads/1553898397_IMG_0549.jpg" data-src="/remote/direct_uploads/1553898397_IMG_0549.jpg" alt="blog image" /></p>
    <p>My ticket included a box meal and a ½ day guided bus and walking tour of the historic city of Colonia. When I docked in Colonia I quickly hopped on the bus tour which did a loop by some of the historic sights further away from the city center. Next was the walking tour of the historic quarter. The guide gave us a rich history lesson on the alternating occupation by the Spanish and Portuguese and how to identify if the Spanish or the Portuguese built a particular building or street. After the tour everyone in the group had the option to hop on the bus to more fully explore the sights that we drove past earlier in the day, which included the ruins of an old coliseum and a beautiful sandy beach. However, there were some ominous looking storm clouds rolling in and our guide was quick to mention that maybe this wasn’t the best time to hop on the bus and go to the beach.</p>
    <aside class="aside-left">PRO TIP: There is no need to exchange money for a day trip to Colonia, every place we entered accepted both Argentine pesos, US dollars as well as Euros and currencies from other parts of South America.</aside>
    
    <p>Since it was a ½ day walking tour, when I finished, it was time to find lunch. I got a restaurant recommendation from the tour guide and stopped in for a bite to eat and to try some Uruguayan Tannat, a lovely red wine that Uruguay is known for. After a leisurely lunch I walked to the church and lighthouse, two of the major landmarks still standing in the historic quarter. The church was quiet, small and simple on first glance. I learned from the guide that it had undergone many changes in the past depending on who was occupying the town at the time. The lighthouse had a very tight spiral staircases that was a little treacherous but the top provided stunning views of ocean and a unique perspective of the city. </p>
    <p>All in all, I was in and around Colonia for about eight hours. In my opinion, that was the perfect amount of time. Maybe if it had not threatened to storm, and I was able to spend some time on the beach or walking around some of the more remote stops on the bus route, I would have wanted more time. </p>
    <p>I love doing quick city tours, especially when I am only in a location for a short amount of time. I find I gain a greater appreciation for a city than I do from reading the overview in a travel book or on the Internet. I also love the little personal touches a good local guide will throw in about their city. What do you prefer? Do you like having a tour guide? Do you prefer a self guided tour? Or do you just wander around and discover as you go?</p>
