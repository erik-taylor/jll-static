    <p>I am 28 years old and I have traveled all over the world, sometimes in luxury and sometimes on a very small budget. I have traveled with loved ones and had adventures surrounded by strangers. I have had everything go my way and I have cried myself to sleep in the lobby of a hostel after my bank account had been hacked, unsure how I was going to get home.  The one constant in all my travel is that I always travel with my childhood stuffed animal, Sunny.</p>
    <p>It all started on my 8th birthday when I received a stuffed yellow lab puppy and named him Sunny (or rather TY named him sunny and I went with it).  That year, I had my first experience with sleep away camp and Sunny was right there with me and when I lay in my bunk wishing my parents were there to tuck me in Sunny provided a small sense of home. Sunny has been my ride or die every since and went on to spend 11 more summers at camp and go on every ski trip, spring break road trip and international holiday for the past 20 years.</p>
    <p>While it has been sometime since my parents tucked me in at night, Sunny still goes on all my adventures and provides an abundance of benefits.</p>
    <aside class="aside-right">
    The one constant in all my travel is that I always travel with my childhood stuffed animal, Sunny.
    </aside>
    
    <ol>
    <li><p>His smell (I don’t think he has ever actually been washed) keeps me grounded when my anxiety is high. I found that I am most anxious at night, attempting to sleep in unfamiliar beds and having that comforting smell of Sunny cuddled close helps keep the anxiety levels low and allows me to get a decent night sleep.  </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>His is body is the perfect length to go behind my neck and I can rest my head on his head like a neck pillow on long flight. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>If the jetlag hits me particular hard and I need to sleep in the middle of the day, I can drape his body over my face like an eye mask.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Once the maid service in a hotel gave me extra chocolate on my pillow because they thought there was a kid staying in the room too!</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Posting a picture of him at the airport is way to humble brag on Instagram know and let everyone know that I am traveling again (didn’t she JUST get back from a trip?), and he is way cuter than a picture of the wing of the airplane.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So yes, I am a grown ass, independent and well-traveled 28-year-old woman and the number on thing on every packing list I make is my favorite childhood stuffed animal.  What was your favorite toy as a kid and do you still have it? If you do, leave a picture of it in the comments, I want to see your buddy!</p>

    						<p>Hello there, I’m Leah, a 20-something living in San Diego, CA with a goal of traveling as much as my job will allow. I believe life is always a little more exciting when I have a trip to look forward to, even if it is just a weekend stay in the next town over.
